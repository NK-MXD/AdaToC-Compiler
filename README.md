# About the Project
The project is to implement transform from high-level language Ada to high-level language C or others. It is the author's undergraduate graduation design.

## TimeLine

2023.10.1 ~ 2023.10.31: rganize Ada Synatx Grammer and Write cases.
2023.11.1 ~ 2023.11.31: build benchmark of the program.
2023.12.1 ~ 2023.12.31: explore the implement frame of Ada to C.
2024.1.1 ~ 2024.1.31: try to implement the synax analysize of Ada to C.
